Masculinity is at the heart of our belief
[maðr/Mannr](https://www.koeblergerhard.de/an/an_m.html) is the [essence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essence) for masculinity, so a fundamental property that things/beings can have
Why does it matter? Männlichkeit increases your quality of life (as it answers the question what it requires to live a meaningful and joyful life)
More importantly, by increasing your Männlichkeit, it also impacts your environment as a cascading effect

Everything must fit into a logical and believable framework
Scientology - must extend science

Core values:
- Action
    - Work
- Strength (emotional & physical)
- Focus
