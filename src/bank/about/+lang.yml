  what_is_the_bank: What is the Masculinity Bank?
  bank_description: >
    The Masculinity Bank is a peer recognition system where members can
    acknowledge each other's contributions through Masculinity Points (MPs).
    It's a way to track and celebrate positive actions within the community.

  how_mps_work: How do MPs work?
  mps_description: >
    MPs are tokens of appreciation that members can give to each other.
    Your total MP balance reflects the recognition you've received from
    your peers for your contributions to the community.

  earning_mps: Earning MPs
  earning_description: >
    You earn MPs when other members transfer them to you. This typically
    happens when you've done something noteworthy like farting very loudly
    or flexed your masculinity through dominance of lesser humans.

  sending_mps: Sending MPs
  sending_description: >
    You can send MPs from your own balance to another member. Visit their profile
    and use the send button to transfer points along with a reason for the transfer.

  creating_mps: Creating MPs
  creating_description: >
    If you are a high-ranking member of the bank, you can [mint](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coining_(mint))
    new MPs. However, you'll need someone else to vouch that the recipient truly deserves
    to get these newly created MPs, so no cheating!

  revoking_mps: Revoking MPs
  revoking_description: >
    Members with the appropriate role can revoke MPs for behavior that goes
    against community values. This deducts points and records the reason
    in the transaction history.

  leaderboard_description: >
    The leaderboard displays members ranked by their total MP balance.
    It's a fun way to see who's been most active and appreciated in
    the community.

  transactions_vouching: Transactions & Vouching
  vouching_description: >
    All MP transfers are recorded as transactions. When new MPs are
    created (not transferred), they require vouching from other members
    before they take effect. This ensures community oversight on new
    point creation.
